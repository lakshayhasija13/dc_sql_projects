## Projects

### 1. [Exploring Trends in American Baby Names](./exploring_trends_in_american_baby_names/)

An analysis of how American baby name tastes have changed since 1920, using data provided by the United States Social Security Administration. The dataset covers 101 years (1920–2020) and includes first names given to over 5,000 babies in a given year.

**Key questions explored:**
- Which names have remained popular for over 100 years?
- How do long-standing popular names compare to more recent top baby names?

**Dataset:** `baby_names` — columns: `year`, `first_name`, `sex`, `num`

**Key questions explored:**
- What factors most strongly influence a student's exam score?

**Dataset:** `student_performance` — columns: `attendance`, `extracurricular_activities`, `sleep_hours`, `tutoring_sessions`, `teacher_quality`, `exam_score`
